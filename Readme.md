# Embrace your inner idiot

## Run the executable via the commandline with the following args:

For a random male voice:
- `animal_crossing_thingo -m` or `animal_crossing_thingo -male`

For a random female voice:
- `animal_crossing_thingo -f` or `animal_crossing_thingo -female`

You can also select 1 - 4 of the options yourself for either:
- `animal_crossing_thingo -m --voice 4`
- `animal_crossing_thingo -f --voice 2`

Minimize the console and enjoy your new life.

Instantly returns out of the console when it gets a bad argument; can't be arsed spending more time on making it fancy because this is for my amusement.

No config.

No escape.
